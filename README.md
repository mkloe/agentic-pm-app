# Agentic PM — Mini Project Management Board

A realistic Trello/Jira-style project management app built as the sample codebase for **The Agentic PM** course.

Throughout the course, you'll use this codebase to practice AI-assisted product management workflows — including MCP integrations, codebase diagramming, AI-driven exploration, and more. The scenario: *you work for a PM tool startup, and this is your product's codebase.*

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + **shadcn/ui** components
- **@dnd-kit** — drag-and-drop Kanban board
- **Recharts** — dashboard analytics charts
- **Local JSON storage** (`data/db.json`) — no database setup needed

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate seed data (1 project, 5 team members, 18 tasks)
pnpm seed

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you'll land on the Projects page.

## Features

| Page | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Projects** (`/projects`) | Browse project cards, create new projects |
| **Board** (`/projects/[id]/board`) | Kanban board with 4 columns — drag tasks between statuses |
| **Backlog** (`/projects/[id]/backlog`) | Table view with filtering by status, priority, and assignee |
| **Dashboard** (`/projects/[id]/dashboard`) | Stats cards + bar charts for status, priority, and workload |
| **Team** (`/team`) | Team member cards showing task counts and story points |

## REST API

All data is exposed via REST endpoints — useful for MCP integrations and API exploration exercises.

| Endpoint | Methods |
|----------|---------|
| `/api/projects` | GET, POST |
| `/api/projects/[id]` | GET, PATCH, DELETE |
| `/api/tasks` | GET (?projectId, ?status, ?priority), POST |
| `/api/tasks/[id]` | GET, PATCH, DELETE |
| `/api/tasks/reorder` | PATCH |
| `/api/team` | GET |
| `/api/labels` | GET |
| `/api/dashboard/[projectId]` | GET |

## Seed Data

Running `pnpm seed` creates sample data with:

- **1 project** — "Agentic PM App" (key: PM)
- **5 team members** — Sarah Chen (PM), Marcus Johnson (FE), Aisha Patel (BE), Tom Wilson (Design), Elena Rodriguez (Full-Stack)
- **6 labels** — Bug, Feature, Enhancement, Documentation, Design, Tech Debt
- **18 tasks** — spread across all statuses with varied priorities, assignees, and due dates
