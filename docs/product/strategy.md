# Product Strategy

## Vision
A lightweight project management tool for small teams (5-20 people) who find Jira too complex and Trello too basic.

## Positioning
"The project board that gets out of your way."
- Not a Jira replacement — no workflows, no custom fields maze, no admin certification needed
- Not a Trello clone — has real structure (priorities, story points, dashboard)
- Sweet spot: teams that need a board + backlog + basic analytics, nothing more

## Target Market
- Early-stage startups (5-20 people)
- Product/engineering teams inside larger companies who want their own lightweight tool
- Freelancers managing multiple client projects

## Current Stage: MVP
- Core features shipped: board, backlog, dashboard, team view
- Local storage only (no auth, no multi-user)
- Next milestone: user accounts + real-time collaboration

## Key Differentiators
1. **Zero setup**: clone, seed, run — working board in 2 minutes
2. **API-first**: every feature accessible via REST API (enables integrations and MCP)
3. **Opinionated simplicity**: 4 statuses, 4 priorities, no custom fields — by design
