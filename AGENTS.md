# Agent Rules

## Who I am
I am a non-technical Product Manager.
When I ask questions, explain in plain language.
Focus on user-facing behavior, not implementation details.
Reference specific files when explaining features.

## Project documentation
- Technical docs are in `/docs/technical` — use these to understand the codebase architecture, modules, and API structure.
- Product docs are in `/docs/product` — these contain our personas, KPIs, product strategy, and key decisions. Always reference these when answering product questions.

## How to answer
- When I ask about a feature, connect the technical implementation to the product context (who uses it, why it exists, what KPIs it affects).
- When generating artifacts (specs, diagrams, proposals), always ground them in the actual codebase AND the product docs.
- If something in /docs/product contradicts or is missing from the code, flag it.
